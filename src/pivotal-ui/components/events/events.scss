Event handling in our system is handled through a document level message bus.
This system works by publishing events when a component performs an action and
letting that action bubble up to the `document`. If another component needs to
interact with the first component, it can listen for that component's events
at the `document` level.

Example:

Component ğŸ’£ has a method `ğŸ”¥`. In the code, you might see:


<code class="pam">
ğŸ’£.prototype.ğŸ”¥ = function(blaze){
  $(this).trigger("ğŸ’£:ğŸ”¥:before");
  //do things

  // this represent the element the component is referring to
  $(this).trigger("ğŸ’£:ğŸ”¥");
};
</code>

In another component ğŸš°, we have a method ğŸŒŠ. We know that when the ğŸ’£
component has the ğŸ”¥ method called and that method is completed, the ğŸš°
component needs to call the ğŸŒŠ method.

<code class="pam">
$(document).on("ğŸ’£:ğŸ”¥", function(){
  ğŸš°.ğŸŒŠ();
});
</code>
